      description: 'Dype is a startup company that me and my buddies founded in March, 2019. We came out of the Columbia IBM Blockchain Accelerator. Dype\'s vision is to create a decentralized marketplace for resold goods in streetwear. We built a mobile application that is currently out on the App/Play Store, and also a simple web marketplace that is connected to the Ethereum blockchain. During the birth of Dype, we practiced the Lean Startup Method and Scrum. Interviewing customers was a daily activity and I got pretty comfortable with it too. I was also responsible for pitching the company idea multiple times to grand audiences, which has made me more comfortable with public speaking and conveying complex ideas for anyone to understand.',
