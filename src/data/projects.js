As a cohort of 20-30 students, we partnered with local businesses to help them for free. The spectrum of our services ranged from marketing to building websites. We were trained for a couple weeks by IDEO Labs in design thinking to help create solutions for problems that other businesses have. One of my very first project was helping the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers manage their social media. I created content in the form of posters and videos to help market the annual event of SHPE. We were offered some pretty sweet deals that included a free ticket to the event and housing for the event.'
