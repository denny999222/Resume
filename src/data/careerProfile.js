  description: '<p> Coding/Programming was something I never intended to feel this much passion about. The closest I\'ve gotten to actual computer related activities was building redstone circuits in Minecraft in middle school. Which ironically, has more to do with hardware than software. I first stumbled across programming in my senior year of high school, when I signed up for an AP Computer Science course. My first program was a simple cash register that would efficiently return the least amount of bills and coins as change, when given any amount! Almost immediately, I saw the beauty of creating something from scratch. As I came closer to the realization that anything and everything can be programmed from scratch, was when I started diving deeper into the subject. Go down and view my projects to see how far I\'ve come!  </p>'
